## Online Documentation

Currently we have hosted here for your convenience. First, we have documentation
for the current release version:

[Latest Release](../doc/Latest/index.html)

We also have rolling documentation about the master branch generated by our
contiguous integration system.

[Rolling Documentation](../doc/master/index.html)

For legacy purposes, we also maintain documentation of the version submitted
to Computer Physics Communications:

[NTPoly CPC Submission](../doc/CPC/index.html)

## Local Documentation

To build local documentation, after building NTPoly stay in the Build directory
and type:

> make doc

## Further Help

There is also supplementary documentation available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/william-dawson/NTPoly/wiki). This includes details
about all of the matrix functions implemented and
[frequently asked questions](https://github.com/william-dawson/NTPoly/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)
