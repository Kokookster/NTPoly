## Online Documentation

Currently we have hosted here for your convenience. First, we have documentation
for the current release version:

* [2.7 Fortran Documentation](../doc/2.7/Fortran/index.html)
* [2.7 C++ Documentation](../doc/2.7/CPlusPlus/index.html)

For legacy purposes, we also maintain documentation of the final version 1.0
series release:

[NTPoly 1.3](../doc/1.3/index.html)

And the version submitted to Computer Physics Communications:

[NTPoly CPC Submission](../doc/CPC/index.html)

## Local Documentation

To build local documentation, after building NTPoly stay in the Build directory
and type:

> make doc

## NTChem Documentation

A special version of NTPoly has been built for integration into the NTChem
code. This documentation can be viewed below:

* [Future Fortran Documentation](../doc/NTChem/Fortran/index.html)
* [Future C++ Documentation](../doc/NTChem/CPlusPlus/index.html)

## Further Help

There is also supplementary documentation available on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/william-dawson/NTPoly/wiki). This includes details
about all of the matrix functions implemented and
[frequently asked questions](https://github.com/william-dawson/NTPoly/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)
