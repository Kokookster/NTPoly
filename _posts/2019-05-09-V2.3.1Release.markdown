[Version 2.3.1](/NTPoly/downloads) of NTPoly is now available.

Version 2.3.1 contains some minor fixes and improvements.

Bug Fixes:
* Major fix to the implementation of the purification based extrapolation
 technique (thanks to Victor Yu).

Features:
* Rubennson's Scale and Fold purification technique.

Miscellaneous:
* cmake now automatically handles the use of position independent code.
* More options for cmake.
* Improvements to the CI system.

I would note that the Scale and Fold technique requires knowledge about the
homo and lumo band locations, which makes it less easy to use. However, the
performance is good, so I think this should at least be included as a
benchmark to compare new methods against.

I hope that this new version of NTPoly is easier to compile. I am also planning
on adding it to the SPACK package manager soon.
