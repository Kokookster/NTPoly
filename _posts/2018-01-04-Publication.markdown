I'm pleased to announce that a publication describing the techniques used
in NTPoly is now available in Computer Physics Communications.

> Dawson, William, and Takahito Nakajima. "Massively parallel sparse matrix
> function calculations with NTPoly." Computer Physics Communications (2017).

This paper describes in detail the computational techniques at the heart of
NTPoly. We also described several example applications of NTPoly, which I
hope might inspire future users. As of the posting of this update, the paper
is still in a preprint stage. However, I expect a fully edited version will
be available shortly.
