NTPoly now uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform contiguous
integration. We'll still perform local regular compilation tests, since
Travis CI doesn't provide every possible environment (for example, Intel
clusters). However, hopefully this will help us catch bugs easier, and
make it easier to perform pull requests.

One of the main challenges I faced when adding Travis CI support was setting
up newer versions of libraries. NTPoly requires MPI version 3, as well as
up to date versions of Swig and Cmake. Unfortunately, those don't come by
default in the Travis CI environment. This means that currently we have to
install some libraries from source, which makes the integration tests very
slow. In the future, hopefully we can use something like docker to speed
up this process.
