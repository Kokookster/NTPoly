[Version 2.3](/NTPoly/downloads) of NTPoly is now available.

Version 2.3 is mostly a bug fix release.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed linkage error that was present when using MPICH and GCC together.
* Fixed bug where unit tests would fail when not using the git repository.
* Fixed I/O when using the Cray compilers.

Miscellaneous:
* Fixed documentation errors.
* Made readmes easier to read when rendered.
* Removed some compilation noise.
* Improved unit test code by using join instead of + "/", and did various code
reductions.

Special thanks to Jacob Leamer and Laura Ratcliff for their assistance with
these bug fixes.
