I have merged the Dense Algebra branche into the master
branch. Now if NTPoly
detects that two matrix blocks are both dense (>30% full), it will perform
a dense matrix multiply. This optimization might sound like what is done
in the DBCSR[1] library, but it's not nearly that fancy. It is really meant for
if you're trying to compare to the full dense solution, because our block sizes
are still fairly large.
