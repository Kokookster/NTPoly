I have merged the Dense Algebra and Nonsymmetric branches into the master
branch. There are two main changes as a result. First, now if NTPoly
detects that two matrix blocks are both dense (>30% full), it will perform
a dense matrix multiply. This optimization might sound like what is done
in the DBCSR[1] library, but it's not nearly that fancy. It is really meant for
if you're trying to compare to the full dense solution, because our block sizes
are still fairly large.

Second I've added a method for computing the matrix exponential of a
non-symmetric matrix. To use this feature, call the subroutine
`ComputeExponentialPade`. I was going to wait to merge this branch into the
master until all the matrix functions had non-symmetric versions, but the
prospect of computing the exponential of undirected graphs was too tantalizing
to wait. Feel free to try this experimental method out.
