A new release of NTPoly (1.2) is now available. The release is available on
the [download](/NTPoly/downloads) page. Apart from minor bug corrections and
feature enhancements, the main modification for version 1.2 were simplifications
to the build process. This was an essentially step for helping integrate
NTPoly into other library's build systems, so I decided to release these
modifications as a new release.
