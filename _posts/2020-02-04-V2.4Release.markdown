[Version 2.4](/NTPoly/downloads) of NTPoly is now available.

The main improvement in 2.4 is related to dense matrix operations. As a backup
plan, NTPoly can convert to dense matrix multiplication when it determines that 
a block is not very sparse. I noticed that there were some potential bugs in 
this code when using older compilers. I also discovered that the performance 
was sub-optimal because we were still transposing those matrices using the 
sparse data structures. Version 2.4 fixes those issues, and in general improves
the code.

As another minor improvement, I've set the matrix maps module to allow optional
arguments.

Finally, we've fully switched from Travis-CI to Github actions, and I've
removed any legacy files that were only there for Travis.
