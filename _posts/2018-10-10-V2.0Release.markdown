[Version 2.0](/NTPoly/downloads) of NTPoly is now available.

Version 2.0 adds two major features:
1. Support for complex matrices.
2. Support for multiple process grids.

In order to support these features, I made significant changes to the user
interface. Please see the revised examples and documentation.
