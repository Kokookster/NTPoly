A new release of NTPoly (1.1) is now available. The list of changes
can be seen at the
[github release page](https://github.com/william-dawson/NTPoly/releases/tag/v1.1)
. Apart from the inclusion of new features, this version also improves the
documentation and compilation, so I highly recommend starting from this version.
