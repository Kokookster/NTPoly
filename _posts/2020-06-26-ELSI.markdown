As mentioned in a previous post, NTPoly has been included into the ELSI
solver suite. Today, I am announcing the release of a paper describing this
integration:

> V. W.-z. Yu, C. Campos, W. Dawson, A. García, V. Havu, B. Hourahine, W. P. 
> Huhn, M. Jacquelin, W. Jia, M. Keçeli, R. Laasner, Y. Li, L. Lin, J. Lu, 
> J. Moussa, J. E. Roman, Á. Vázquez-Mayagoitia, C. Yang, and V. Blum, ELSI – 
> An Open Infrastructure for Electronic Structure Solvers, Computer Physics 
> Communications, in press (2020).

While significant emphasis has been put on making NTPoly easy to integrate
into your code, there is real added value in using it through ELSI. First,
when using ELSI you automatically will gain access to other solvers, making it
easy to switch solver approaches based on what you want to achieve. Second,
ELSI provides all kinds of helper routines for electronic structure
calculations

Thanks to ELSI project, you can now use NTPoly from two popular electronic
structure programs: DFTB+ and Siesta. I hope you will try it out and send
back your feedback.
